How do we solve

$$\der[2]{}{t} u = f(t,u), \quad u(0) = u_0, \quad u'(0) = v_0, \quad t \geq 0$$

St\"ormer Verlet Integration:

$t_k = k\tau$, $\tau$ time step size, then let $u_k \approx u(t_k)$

Define:

$$u_1 = u_0 + \tau v_0 + \frac{\tau^2}{2} f(t_0,u_0)$$

Then iterate via:

$$u_{k+1} = 2u_{k} - u_{k-1} + \tau^2 f(t_k,u_k), \quad k \geq 1$$

Verlet's method can be shown to be $O(\tau^2)$ \cite{md-verlet}

It also has the added benefit of conserving energy
